        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I helped to develop an iPhone app which did some basic DSP
processing on the iPhone’s microphone signal. Since then, I have seen a
barrage of questions on StackOverflow with people who want to this and are
having trouble doing so. The biggest barrier seems to be not the actual DSP
processing, but all of the associated framework stuff to get the iPhone to
send you a raw PCM data stream.</p>

<p>Apple has some documentation on both subjects, but not really enough to figure
out how to put all the pieces together. So without further ado, let’s get
started.</p>

<h2 id="wait-a-second--before-you-read-any-further">WAIT A SECOND – BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER</h2>

<p>Yes, this blog post is going to tell you how to do real-time audio processing
on iOS, the hard and old-fashioned way. So before we get started with the
dirty details, it’s worth asking yourself if you really, really need to do
things the hard way.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.teragonaudio.com/website/road-to-heaven-or-hell.jpg" alt="Which path do you really want to choose?" /></p>

<p>There is actually an easier way to do all of this, and it’s a framework called
<a href="https://github.com/alexbw/novocaine">novocaine</a>. The framework name says it all; it provides a painless way of
doing something otherwise would be very painful. And believe me, doing these
low level audio operations on iOS can be quite painful. This framework
provides a easy way to do audio processing on iOS, giving the programmer a
simple block-based callback which contains the DSP code.</p>

<p>Before you continue reading this article, please, check out novacaine’s GitHub
page. If that framework doesn’t meet your needs, then feel free to continue
reading and doing things the hard way.</p>

<h2 id="how-ios-buffers-audio">How iOS buffers audio</h2>

<p>One of the most difficult tripping blocks for people wanting to program audio
for iOS is how it deals with audio buffering. Unlike in the VST world where
your code is simply delivered a nice array of floats, you need to tell the
iPhone exactly how to pack up the data blocks and send them to you. If you
do not tell it this properly, you will get a not helpful error code and be
stuck scratching your head.</p>

<p>First, one needs to understand a bit of terminology. A sample is a single
point of audio data, sometimes called a sample frame. A group of samples comes
together to make a channel, just like the left &amp; right channels of a stereo
signal. Finally, a packet contains one or more channels.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.teragonaudio.com/website/ios-buffers.png" alt="Visual representation of iOS buffers" /></p>

<p>You might be wondering why each channel only contains one frame. I don’t know
the answer to that; at least on the iPhone this is simply the way that audio
is delivered to you.</p>

<h2 id="audiounits-on-ios">AudioUnits on iOS</h2>

<p>If you are used to developing AudioUnits on Mac OSX, you might think that
AudioUnit development on iOS is going to be basically the same thing. And it
is, depending on how you define the word “basically”. The architecture is
fundamentally the same, but rather than loading plugins from bundles, you
basically do your processing directly in the graph. So if you are trying to
port an AU from the Mac to iOS, it’s going to take more work than just hitting
recompile.</p>

<p>If you are trying to port a VST/AU algorithm to iOS, hopefully the process()
function is well abstracted and written in very vanilla C. If so, then you can
easily drop this code into an iOS AudioUnit for processing.</p>

<h2 id="initializing-the-audio-subsystem">Initializing the audio subsystem</h2>

<p>When you are ready to start processing audio, you need to create your
AudioUnit and get the system ready to start delivering you sound. That routine
looks something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">// Yeah, global variables suck, but it&#39;s kind of a necessary evil here
AudioUnit *audioUnit = NULL;
float *convertedSampleBuffer = NULL;

int initAudioSession() {
  audioUnit = (AudioUnit*)malloc(sizeof(AudioUnit));

  if(AudioSessionInitialize(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  if(AudioSessionSetActive(true) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  UInt32 sessionCategory = kAudioSessionCategory_PlayAndRecord;
  if(AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_AudioCategory,
     sizeof(UInt32), &amp;sessionCategory) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  Float32 bufferSizeInSec = 0.02f;
  if(AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_PreferredHardwareIOBufferDuration,
     sizeof(Float32), &amp;bufferSizeInSec) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  UInt32 overrideCategory = 1;
  if(AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryDefaultToSpeaker,
     sizeof(UInt32), &amp;overrideCategory) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  // There are many properties you might want to provide callback functions for:
  // kAudioSessionProperty_AudioRouteChange
  // kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryEnableBluetoothInput
  // etc.

  return 0;
}</code></pre></figure>

<p>Unlike audio on the desktop, you don’t get to tell the system your buffer
size. Instead, you can ask the system to provide you with an approximate
buffer size. iOS does not guarantee to return the exact buffer size that
you’ve asked for, but it will give you something which works for the device
and is near what you request. Certain types of DSP applications, such as those
using FFT, will greatly benefit from having known buffer sizes during runtime
or compile time, but most other audio effect processing shouldn’t matter too
much. Unless you need a specific buffer size, you should code flexibly and let
the system decide for you.</p>

<p>If you do need a specific buffer size, however, you should create
statically-sized structures and proxy buffers to deliver them to the size that
iOS determines. This will introduce extra latency, but will improve
performance in these cases. And please note, this in a very small number of
cases. Most people shouldn’t need to worry about this.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-streams">Setting up your streams</h2>

<p>Before you can call AudioUnitInitialize(), you need to tell the system what
type of streams you expect to have. That code will look something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">int initAudioStreams(AudioUnit *audioUnit) {
  UInt32 audioCategory = kAudioSessionCategory_PlayAndRecord;
  if(AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_AudioCategory,
     sizeof(UInt32), &amp;audioCategory) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }
  
  UInt32 overrideCategory = 1;
  if(AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryDefaultToSpeaker,
     sizeof(UInt32), &amp;overrideCategory) != noErr) {
    // Less serious error, but you may want to handle it and bail here
  }
  
  AudioComponentDescription componentDescription;
  componentDescription.componentType = kAudioUnitType_Output;
  componentDescription.componentSubType = kAudioUnitSubType_RemoteIO;
  componentDescription.componentManufacturer = kAudioUnitManufacturer_Apple;
  componentDescription.componentFlags = 0;
  componentDescription.componentFlagsMask = 0;
  AudioComponent component = AudioComponentFindNext(NULL, &amp;componentDescription);
  if(AudioComponentInstanceNew(component, audioUnit) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  UInt32 enable = 1;
  if(AudioUnitSetProperty(*audioUnit, kAudioOutputUnitProperty_EnableIO,
     kAudioUnitScope_Input, 1, &amp;enable, sizeof(UInt32)) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  AURenderCallbackStruct callbackStruct;
  callbackStruct.inputProc = renderCallback; // Render function
  callbackStruct.inputProcRefCon = NULL;
  if(AudioUnitSetProperty(*audioUnit, kAudioUnitProperty_SetRenderCallback,
     kAudioUnitScope_Input, 0, &amp;callbackStruct,
     sizeof(AURenderCallbackStruct)) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  AudioStreamBasicDescription streamDescription;
  // You might want to replace this with a different value, but keep in mind that the
  // iPhone does not support all sample rates. 8kHz, 22kHz, and 44.1kHz should all work.
  streamDescription.mSampleRate = 44100;
  // Yes, I know you probably want floating point samples, but the iPhone isn&#39;t going
  // to give you floating point data. You&#39;ll need to make the conversion by hand from
  // linear PCM &lt;-&gt; float.
  streamDescription.mFormatID = kAudioFormatLinearPCM;
  // This part is important!
  streamDescription.mFormatFlags = kAudioFormatFlagIsSignedInteger |
    kAudioFormatFlagsNativeEndian |
    kAudioFormatFlagIsPacked;
  // Not sure if the iPhone supports recording &gt;16-bit audio, but I doubt it.
  streamDescription.mBitsPerChannel = 16;
  // 1 sample per frame, will always be 2 as long as 16-bit samples are being used
  streamDescription.mBytesPerFrame = 2;
  // Record in mono. Use 2 for stereo, though I don&#39;t think the iPhone does true stereo recording
  streamDescription.mChannelsPerFrame = 1;
  streamDescription.mBytesPerPacket = streamDescription.mBytesPerFrame *
    streamDescription.mChannelsPerFrame;
  // Always should be set to 1
  streamDescription.mFramesPerPacket = 1;
  // Always set to 0, just to be sure
  streamDescription.mReserved = 0;

  // Set up input stream with above properties
  if(AudioUnitSetProperty(*audioUnit, kAudioUnitProperty_StreamFormat,
     kAudioUnitScope_Input, 0, &amp;streamDescription, sizeof(streamDescription)) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Ditto for the output stream, which we will be sending the processed audio to
  if(AudioUnitSetProperty(*audioUnit, kAudioUnitProperty_StreamFormat,
     kAudioUnitScope_Output, 1, &amp;streamDescription, sizeof(streamDescription)) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre></figure>

<p>It might be tempting to use the kAudioFormatFlagIsFloat flag when setting up
your stream. It will even compile on Xcode without any warnings. However, that
will not run on an actual iPhone, so you need to construct your app to use
linear PCM and convert it to floating point data if necessary. This is one of
the “gotchas” that trips up many developers.</p>

<h2 id="starting-audio-processing">Starting audio processing</h2>

<p>At this point, everything is ready to go and we can tell the OS to start
recording and sending us data.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">int startAudioUnit(AudioUnit *audioUnit) {
  if(AudioUnitInitialize(*audioUnit) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  if(AudioOutputUnitStart(*audioUnit) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="processing-data-in-the-callback">Processing data in the callback</h2>

<p>At this point, the system will now call your rendering function whenever it
wants audio. Generally speaking, you will want to convert the linear PCM data
to floating point, which is much easier to work with. However, in some cases
(like an echo plugin), you may not necessarily need to manipulate the samples
and can keep the data in linear PCM. The below example demonstrates floating
point data conversion, but if you can do everything with integer math, it will
of course be more efficient.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">OSStatus renderCallback(void *userData, AudioUnitRenderActionFlags *actionFlags,
                        const AudioTimeStamp *audioTimeStamp, UInt32 busNumber,
                        UInt32 numFrames, AudioBufferList *buffers) {
  OSStatus status = AudioUnitRender(*audioUnit, actionFlags, audioTimeStamp,
    1, numFrames, buffers);
  if(status != noErr) {
    return status;
  }

  if(convertedSampleBuffer == NULL) {
    // Lazy initialization of this buffer is necessary because we don&#39;t
    // know the frame count until the first callback
    convertedSampleBuffer = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * numFrames);
  }

  SInt16 *inputFrames = (SInt16*)(buffers-&gt;mBuffers-&gt;mData);

  // If your DSP code can use integers, then don&#39;t bother converting to
  // floats here, as it just wastes CPU. However, most DSP algorithms rely
  // on floating point, and this is especially true if you are porting a
  // VST/AU to iOS.
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; numFrames; i++) {
    convertedSampleBuffer[i] = (float)inputFrames[i] / 32768f;
  }

  // Now we have floating point sample data from the render callback! We
  // can send it along for further processing, for example:
  // plugin-&gt;processReplacing(convertedSampleBuffer, NULL, sampleFrames);

  // Assuming that you have processed in place, we can now write the
  // floating point data back to the input buffer.
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; numFrames; i++) {
    // Note that we multiply by 32767 here, NOT 32768. This is to avoid
    // overflow errors (and thus clipping).
    inputFrames[i] = (SInt16)(convertedSampleBuffer[i] * 32767f);
  }

  return noErr;
}</code></pre></figure>

<p>Keep in mind that this code will be called several times <em>per second</em>. Best
development practices tend to advocate lazy initialization and runtime checks
to keep readability. This is not necessarily a best practice when it comes to
audio development, however. The name of the game here is to move anything you
can out of render and into the initialize function. This includes things like
allocating blocks of memory and calling system functions. In the best case,
your render function will just loop over the input buffer and perform simple
mathematical operations on the samples. Even a single malloc call (or even
worse, an Obj-C <code>[[[ClassName alloc] init] autorelease]</code> allocation) in the
render call is likely to grind your code to a halt or leak memory like crazy.</p>

<p>Same goes with <code>NSLog()</code> or <code>printf()</code>. Those functions should never be called
from within render, except possibly during development. Since Xcode has a
somewhat weak debugger, I’ve noticed that many iOS developers tend to use
<code>NSLog()</code> for debugging, but I would encourage you to instead be clever and
find other ways of fixing problems in your render routine. The reason why is
that calling slow functions from render may cause a condition I jokingly call
“quantum debugging” where code behaves one way in production runs, but
radically different when being observed. This is rather common when trying to
iron out problems in realtime audio code, especially when it comes to dropouts
and distortion which don’t occur in a “clean” environment.</p>

<h2 id="shutting-down">Shutting down</h2>

<p>When you are finished processing audio, you need to tell the OS to stop
processing and free the AudioUnit’s resources.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">int stopProcessingAudio(AudioUnit *audioUnit) {
  if(AudioOutputUnitStop(*audioUnit) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  if(AudioUnitUninitialize(*audioUnit) != noErr) {
    return 1;
  }

  *audioUnit = NULL;
  return 0;
}</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>

<p>As the point of this tutorial was to demonstrate audio buffer construction and
realtime audio processing, I glossed over a lot of details. But these are
things which you will probably need to take into consideration when developing
an application. Before you start processing audio, you should probably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that the device can record audio (this is not possible for the
iPod Touch without the headset, for instance).</li>
  <li>Check for possible feedback loops, usually caused when the system’s default
input and output are the external mic and speakers. Since the render
callback imposes a few milliseconds of latency and the mic and external
speaker sit very near to each other on the iPhone, there is a very real
possibility of harsh feedback on the device. If you detect a possible
feedback loop, you may want to avoid recording or playback (or both,
depending on your app’s requirements).</li>
  <li>Install a callback function which will be called when the audio route
changes (ie, the user plugs in or disconnects the headset).</li>
  <li>Handle application pausing and switching. If processing is interrupted and
you don’t clear the buffers by zeroing them out, you will get nasty noise
(aka the “satan saw”).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-word-on-developing-audio-on-ios">A word on developing audio on iOS</h2>

<p>Unlike Android, iOS development can be mostly done on the desktop without any
external hardware. Many developers do their entire application development
with the iOS Simulator, which is definitely fine for most day-to-day
development tasks. However, if you are writing audio processing apps for iOS,
you will most definitely need to develop and deploy them to hardware, and
<em>not just during your final testing before submitting them to the app
store</em>.  I can’t stress that last part enough.</p>

<p>The iOS Simulator uses your Mac’s soundcard and CoreAudio, which is much
different than an iPhone or an iPad. Many developers are surprised that simple
audio code which works “perfectly fine” in the iOS Simulator will mysteriously
fail with the dreaded error -50 on iPhone hardware. Likewise, some things work
fine on the hardware but not the simulator. The bottom line is, when you are
developing the DSP part of your app, it needs to be done on hardware and
preferably tested on every iOS device you intend to support.</p>

<p>That said, iOS is not a very efficient platform for developing DSP algorithms,
so you might find it much faster to whip up a quick C++ plugin wrapper using
<a href="http://rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce.php">Juce</a> and get it sounding right on
a desktop sequencer. Once you are happy with the DSP algorithms, you can take
the code (preferably written in very vanilla C) and drop it into the iOS
AudioUnit as described above.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
